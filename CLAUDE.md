# pgsqlite Project Context

## Overview
pgsqlite is a PostgreSQL protocol adapter for SQLite databases, allowing PostgreSQL clients to connect to and query SQLite databases using the PostgreSQL wire protocol.

## Quick Reference

### Build & Test Commands
```bash
cargo build              # Build project
cargo test              # Run unit tests
cargo check             # Check for errors/warnings
cargo clippy            # Check for code quality issues
./tests/runner/run_ssl_tests.sh  # Run integration tests (from project root)
```

**Pre-commit checklist**: Run ALL of these before committing:
1. `cargo check` - No errors or warnings
2. `cargo clippy` - Review and fix warnings where reasonable
3. `cargo build` - Successful build
4. `cargo test` - All tests pass

### Development Workflow
1. Check TODO.md for prioritized tasks
2. Run full test suite after implementing features
3. Update TODO.md: mark completed tasks `[x]`, add new discoveries
4. Follow pre-commit checklist above

## Core Design Principles

### Type Inference
NEVER use column names to infer types. Use only:
- Explicit PostgreSQL type declarations in CREATE TABLE
- SQLite schema info via PRAGMA table_info
- Explicit type casts in queries (e.g., $1::int4)
- Value-based inference as last resort

### DateTime Storage
All datetime types use INTEGER storage (microseconds/days since epoch):
- DATE: INTEGER days since 1970-01-01
- TIME/TIMETZ: INTEGER microseconds since midnight
- TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ: INTEGER microseconds since epoch
- INTERVAL: INTEGER microseconds

### Query Translation
- Full INSERT SELECT support with datetime/array translation
- Decimal aggregates: Only NUMERIC types need decimal_from_text wrapping
- FLOAT types (REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION) don't need wrapping
- Zero performance impact design for all translations

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current Performance (2025-08-12) - psycopg3-text Dominates!

#### With psycopg3-text (BEST SELECT PERFORMANCE - Recommended for read-heavy workloads)
- SELECT: ~125x overhead (0.136ms) - **✓ 21.8x FASTER than psycopg2!**
- SELECT (cached): ~90x overhead (0.299ms) - **✓ 5.5x FASTER than psycopg2**
- UPDATE: ~70x overhead (0.084ms) - Acceptable
- DELETE: ~78x overhead (0.072ms) - Acceptable
- INSERT: ~381x overhead (0.661ms) - Needs optimization
- **Overall**: Best overhead reduction vs native SQLite

#### With psycopg2 (BEST WRITE PERFORMANCE - Recommended for write-heavy workloads)
- SELECT: ~2,692x overhead (2.963ms) - Poor read performance
- SELECT (cached): ~520x overhead (1.656ms) - Poor cache performance
- UPDATE: ~45x overhead (0.057ms) - **✓ MEETS TARGET, 1.5x faster than psycopg3**
- DELETE: ~38x overhead (0.036ms) - **✓ MEETS TARGET, 2.0x faster than psycopg3**
- INSERT: ~107x overhead (0.185ms) - **✓ 3.6x FASTER than psycopg3**

#### With psycopg3-binary (Mixed results - not recommended for simple operations)
- SELECT: ~434x overhead (0.497ms) - Binary encoding overhead exceeds benefits
- SELECT (cached): ~372x overhead (1.579ms) - Poor cache performance
- UPDATE: ~65x overhead (0.086ms) - Similar to text mode
- DELETE: ~67x overhead (0.071ms) - Similar to text mode
- INSERT: ~377x overhead (0.691ms) - Similar to text mode
- **Note**: Binary protocol fully functional but best suited for complex data types

### Performance Targets (2025-07-27)
- SELECT: ~674.9x overhead (0.669ms) **✓ ACHIEVED with psycopg3**
- SELECT (cached): ~17.2x overhead (0.046ms) - In progress
- UPDATE: ~50.9x overhead (0.059ms) **✓ ACHIEVED with psycopg2**
- DELETE: ~35.8x overhead (0.034ms) **✓ ACHIEVED with psycopg2**
- INSERT: ~36.6x overhead (0.060ms) - In progress

**Status**: Major performance breakthrough! psycopg3-binary exceeds all expectations.

### Performance Characteristics
- **psycopg3-binary strongly recommended** - 19x faster SELECT than psycopg2, 5x faster than psycopg3-text
- **Binary protocol advantages** - Native type encoding, reduced parsing overhead
- **Connection-per-session architecture** working well with proper isolation
- **Batch operations provide best performance** (10x-50x speedup)
- **Cache effectiveness needs improvement** - Currently only 0.4x-1.7x speedup

### Batch INSERT Best Practices
```sql
INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES 
  (val1, val2),
  (val3, val4);  -- 10-row: 11.5x speedup, 100-row: 51.3x speedup
```

## Schema Migrations

### Creating New Migrations
When modifying `__pgsqlite_*` tables:

1. Add to `src/migration/registry.rs`:
```rust
register_vX_your_feature(&mut registry);
```

2. Define migration:
```rust
fn register_vX_your_feature(registry: &mut BTreeMap<u32, Migration>) {
    registry.insert(X, Migration {
        version: X,
        name: "feature_name",
        description: "What this does",
        up: MigrationAction::Sql(r#"
            ALTER TABLE __pgsqlite_schema ADD COLUMN new_column TEXT;
        "#),
        down: Some(MigrationAction::Sql(r#"
            -- Rollback SQL
        "#)),
        dependencies: vec![X-1],
    });
}
```

3. Update Current Migrations list in this file

  - SQLAlchemy tests pass with psycopg3-binary driver (9/9 tests passing)
  - Benchmarks now run successfully with psycopg3 binary mode

### Previously Fixed (2025-08-08)

  - Updated integration tests to reflect current binary protocol capabilities
  - Migration tests updated to expect v11 "fix_catalog_views" migration
  - All 8 SQLAlchemy ORM test scenarios now passing including transaction cascade deletes

### Previously Fixed (2025-08-06)
- **Aggregate Function Type Inference**: Fixed "Unknown PG numeric type: 25" errors in psycopg3 text mode
  - Root cause: SUM/AVG aggregate functions returned TEXT (OID 25) instead of NUMERIC (1700) for aliases like `sum_1`, `avg_1`
  - Enhanced `get_aggregate_return_type_with_query()` to detect aliased aggregate functions in query context
  - Added regex pattern matching to identify `sum(...) AS sum_1` and similar SQLAlchemy-generated patterns
  - SUM/AVG functions on arithmetic expressions now always return NUMERIC type regardless of source column types
  - Fixes most psycopg3 compatibility issues where it expects numeric types but receives TEXT for aggregates
  - SQLAlchemy tests improved from 4/8 to 6/8 passing, with aggregate-related errors resolved
- **VALUES Clause Binary Timestamp Handling**: Fixed raw microsecond values in SQLAlchemy multi-row inserts
  - SQLAlchemy VALUES clause pattern was inserting raw microseconds like '807813532548380'
  - Binary timestamp parameters from psycopg3 now detected and converted to formatted strings
  - Only applies to VALUES clause rewriting - normal queries still use raw microseconds for storage
  - Converts PostgreSQL epoch (2000-01-01) to Unix epoch and formats as ISO timestamp string
  - Fixes "timestamp too large (after year 10K)" errors in psycopg3 text mode
- **Transaction Isolation Bug in Schema Lookup**: Fixed SQLAlchemy failing to see schema within same transaction
  - Root cause: `get_schema_type()` used separate connection that couldn't see uncommitted schema changes
  - Created `get_schema_type_with_session()` that uses the session's connection for proper isolation
  - Updated 20+ calls across extended.rs and executor.rs to use session-aware lookup
  - Fixes SQLAlchemy CREATE TABLE followed by INSERT seeing wrong types in same transaction
  - Timestamps now properly formatted as strings instead of raw microseconds
- **Ultra-fast Path Parameter Cast Support**: Fixed queries with parameter casts bypassing optimizations
  - Queries like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1::INTEGER` now use ultra-fast path
  - Modified condition to only exclude non-parameter casts (e.g., `column::TEXT`)
  - Parameter casts (`$1::TYPE`) are common in psycopg3 and now properly optimized
  - Ensures timestamp conversion and other optimizations work with cast parameters
- **psycopg3 Binary Parameter Conversion**: Fixed parameterized queries returning 0 rows
  - Added conversion of PostgreSQL binary format parameters to text format for SQLite
  - Handles INT2, INT4, INT8, FLOAT4, FLOAT8, BOOL, and TIMESTAMP binary formats
  - Converts PostgreSQL timestamp format (microseconds since 2000-01-01) to Unix epoch
  - Fixes issue where psycopg3 sends parameters in binary format even in text mode
- **Scalar Subquery and Direct Aggregate Timestamp Conversion**: Fixed raw microseconds in query results
  - Scalar subqueries like `(SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM table) AS alias` were returning raw INTEGER microseconds
  - Direct aggregates `MAX(created_at)`, `MIN(created_at)` also returned raw values instead of formatted timestamps
  - Added pattern detection in simple query protocol for both scalar subqueries and direct aggregates
  - Detection works in both ultra-simple and non-ultra-simple query paths
  - All aggregate timestamp queries now return properly formatted timestamps in psycopg3 text mode

### Previously Fixed (2025-08-05)
- **Schema-Based Type Inference for Empty Result Sets**: Fixed columns defaulting to TEXT when no data rows
  - All columns were incorrectly returning TEXT (OID 25) instead of proper PostgreSQL types
  - Implemented async schema lookup when queries return no data rows
  - Two-level fallback: alias resolution → table extraction from FROM clause
  - Uses `db.get_schema_type()` to fetch actual types from __pgsqlite_schema
  - Fixes SQLAlchemy lazy loading and relationship queries with proper type OIDs
- **Column Alias Type Inference**: Fixed incorrect PostgreSQL type OIDs for aliased columns

  - Resolves "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Test User'" errors
- **Multi-Row INSERT RETURNING**: Fixed row count mismatch for bulk insert operations
  - SQLAlchemy multi-row INSERT with RETURNING now returns correct number of rows
  - Uses rowid range queries instead of just `last_insert_rowid()` for multiple rows
  - Fixes "Multi-row INSERT statement did not produce the correct number of INSERTed rows" error
- **Date Function Translation**: Fixed malformed SQL in datetime function translation
  - `func.date('now', '-30 days')` no longer creates invalid julianday syntax
  - Skip translation for parameterized date functions to prevent nested cast issues
  - Fixes "SQLite error: near 'AS': syntax error" in datetime queries
- **Aggregate Type Detection**: Fixed unknown PostgreSQL type OID 25 for numeric aggregates
  - AVG/SUM/COUNT on DECIMAL columns now return NUMERIC (1700) instead of TEXT (25)
  - Added query context to `get_aggregate_return_type_with_query()` for better type detection
  - Improved SQLAlchemy compatibility with aggregate functions on numeric columns
- **DateTime Conversion for psycopg3 Text Mode**: Fixed timestamp parsing errors with comprehensive query pattern support
  - psycopg3 text mode was receiving raw INTEGER microseconds like '1754404262713579' instead of formatted timestamps
  - Fixed table-prefixed aliases (`SELECT table.created_at AS alias`) by updating SIMPLE_SELECT_REGEX pattern
  - Fixed wildcard patterns (`SELECT table.*`) with session-based schema lookup for connection-per-session architecture
  - All query patterns now work: `SELECT *`, `SELECT col`, `SELECT table.*`, `SELECT table.col AS alias`
  - Prevents "timestamp too large (after year 10K)" errors in SQLAlchemy datetime queries
- **Column Alias Parsing Robustness**: Fixed extract_source_table_column_for_alias function parsing failures
  - Function was failing to parse `orders.id AS orders_id` patterns in SQLAlchemy lazy loading queries
  - Root cause: Character indexing logic had potential out-of-bounds errors and incorrect expression boundary detection
  - Fixed by rewriting parsing logic using safer string methods (`rfind` for commas, proper SELECT keyword detection)
  - SQLAlchemy lazy loading now correctly returns INT4 (OID 23) instead of TEXT (OID 25) for integer columns

### Previously Fixed (2025-08-04)

## SQLAlchemy Compatibility

**Full SQLAlchemy ORM support** with all tests passing for both psycopg2 and psycopg3-text drivers:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/main')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# All SQLAlchemy operations work correctly:
# - Table creation, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with RETURNING
# - Complex JOINs with proper type inference  
# - Transaction management and persistence
# - Datetime operations with proper formatting
```

**Production Configuration**:
```bash
# Default configuration with connection-per-session architecture
# Each PostgreSQL client session gets its own SQLite connection
# Full SQLAlchemy compatibility with proper transaction isolation
pgsqlite --database mydb.db

# Journal mode options (both work with connection-per-session):
PGSQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE=WAL pgsqlite --database mydb.db    # Better performance
PGSQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE=DELETE pgsqlite --database mydb.db  # More conservative
```

**PostgreSQL Driver Support**:
```bash
# Test with different PostgreSQL drivers
./tests/python/run_sqlalchemy_tests.sh                    # Default psycopg2 (8/8 tests pass)
./tests/python/run_sqlalchemy_tests.sh --driver psycopg3-text   # 8/8 tests pass
./tests/python/run_sqlalchemy_tests.sh --driver psycopg3-binary # Binary protocol support

# psycopg3-text status:
# ✅ Connection, Table Creation, Data Insertion
# ✅ Basic CRUD, Relationships & Joins, Advanced Queries  
# ✅ Numeric Precision with proper type inference
# ✅ Transaction handling with cascade deletes - ALL TESTS PASSING

# psycopg3 binary format provides better performance for:
# - Large binary data (BYTEA)
# - Numeric/Decimal values
# - UUID, JSON/JSONB data
# - Date/Time types
```

## Connection Pooling

Enable for concurrent workloads:
```bash
PGSQLITE_USE_POOLING=true \
PGSQLITE_POOL_SIZE=10 \
pgsqlite --database mydb.db
```

Environment variables:
- `PGSQLITE_USE_POOLING`: Enable pooling (default: false)
- `PGSQLITE_POOL_SIZE`: Max read connections (default: 5)
- `PGSQLITE_POOL_TIMEOUT`: Acquisition timeout seconds (default: 30)

## Quality Standards
- Test edge cases, not just happy paths
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Only mark tasks complete when fully working
- No assumptions - test everything

## Known Limitations
- Array ORDER BY in array_agg relies on outer query ORDER BY
- Multi-array unnest (edge case)
- Some catalog queries and CAST operations still use get_mut_connection (needs update for per-session)

## Code Style
- Follow Rust conventions
- Use existing patterns
- Avoid comments unless necessary
- Keep code concise and idiomatic
