# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 🚀 Performance Optimization Phase 1 - COMPLETED (2025-06-30)

#### Background
Investigated replacing the channel-based DbHandler with a direct multi-threaded implementation using SQLite's FULLMUTEX mode.

#### Performance Findings
Benchmark results comparing implementations (1000 operations each):

| Implementation | INSERT | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Raw SQLite | 0.005ms | 0.006ms | 0.005ms | 0.004ms | Baseline |
| Mutex Handler | 0.036ms | 0.046ms | 0.040ms | 0.038ms | 7.7-9.6x overhead (CHOSEN) |
| Direct Executor | 0.038ms | 0.050ms | 0.043ms | 0.042ms | 8.1-10.7x overhead |
| Simple Executor | 0.036ms | 0.047ms | 0.040ms | 0.039ms | 7.7-9.9x overhead |
| Channel-based | 0.094ms | 0.159ms | 0.092ms | 0.083ms | 20-27x overhead |

### 🗄️ PostgreSQL System Catalog Foundation - PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION (2025-07-03)

#### Background
Started implementation of PostgreSQL system catalogs to support psql \d commands and other PostgreSQL tools that query catalog tables.

#### Work Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive research document (docs/pg_catalog_research.md)
  - Documented PostgreSQL catalog table structures
  - Analyzed psql \d command queries
  - Mapped SQLite metadata to PostgreSQL catalogs
- [x] Implemented pg_class handler (src/catalog/pg_class.rs)
  - Maps SQLite tables and indexes to pg_class format
  - Generates stable OIDs from object names
  - Queries SQLite metadata for relnatts, relhasindex
  - Returns all 28 pg_class columns with appropriate values
- [x] Implemented pg_attribute handler (src/catalog/pg_attribute.rs)
  - Maps PRAGMA table_info to pg_attribute format
  - Integrates with __pgsqlite_schema for PostgreSQL types
  - Falls back to intelligent type inference for unmapped types
  - Handles type modifiers (VARCHAR length, NUMERIC precision/scale)
- [x] Updated CatalogInterceptor to be async and accept DbHandler
  - Routes pg_class and pg_attribute queries to handlers
  - Maintains existing pg_type, pg_namespace support

#### Current Limitations
1. **No Column Projection** - SELECT relname returns all columns
2. **No WHERE Filtering** - WHERE relkind = 'r' returns all rows
3. **No JOIN Support** - Cannot handle psql's complex JOIN queries
4. **Missing System Functions** - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
5. **Incomplete Catalog Tables** - Need pg_index, pg_constraint, pg_am, etc.

#### Testing Results
- Basic pg_class queries work (returns tables and indexes)
- Basic pg_attribute queries work (returns column information)
- psql can connect and query catalogs but \d commands show raw data
- Need proper query processing for full psql compatibility

### 🎯 PostgreSQL Regex Operators Support - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

#### Background
psql \d command failed with "unrecognized token: !" error due to PostgreSQL's regex operators (~ and !~) not being supported in SQLite.

#### Implementation
- [x] Created RegexTranslator to convert PostgreSQL regex operators to SQLite REGEXP
  - Supports all four operators: ~ (match), !~ (not match), ~* (case-insensitive match), !~* (case-insensitive not match)
  - Handles OPERATOR syntax: a OPERATOR(pg_catalog.~) 'pattern'
  - Preserves query structure while translating operators
- [x] Registered REGEXP and REGEXPI functions in SQLite
  - Uses Rust's regex crate for pattern matching
  - REGEXP for case-sensitive matching
  - REGEXPI for case-insensitive matching
- [x] Integrated into query processing pipeline
  - CatalogInterceptor applies regex translation before parsing
  - LazyQueryProcessor includes regex translation in processing steps
  - Works with both simple and extended protocols

#### Testing
- All four regex operators tested and working
- Handles complex queries with multiple regex operations
- Properly escapes special regex characters
- Performance impact minimal due to lazy processing

### 🗂️ PostgreSQL Catalog Tables Implementation - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

  - pg_class view: tables, views, indexes with stable OID generation
  - pg_constraint table: constraint definitions
  - pg_attrdef table: column defaults
  - pg_index table: index information
- [x] Implemented hash functions for OID generation
  - hash(text): general purpose hash function
  - oid_hash(text): generates PostgreSQL-compatible OIDs
  - Deterministic OIDs ensure consistency across queries
- [x] Created SchemaPrefixTranslator
  - Removes pg_catalog. prefix from table/function names
  - Allows PostgreSQL queries to work with SQLite
  - Integrated into query processing pipeline
- [x] Enhanced catalog functions
  - pg_table_is_visible: checks if table is in search path
  - regclass type casting: converts table names to OIDs
  - pg_get_userbyid: returns user name (always 'sqlite')
- [x] Fixed migration system
  - Functions registered before running migrations
  - Handles both new and existing databases correctly

#### Issues Fixed
1. **pg_class Column Count**: Updated from 28 to 33 columns per PostgreSQL 14+ specification
   - Added missing columns: reloftype, relallvisible, relacl, reloptions, relpartbound
   - Updated all related type mappings and handlers

2. **Extended Protocol Field Descriptions**: Fixed UnexpectedMessage errors
   - Field descriptions generated during Describe phase are now properly stored in prepared statements
   - Available during Execute phase for correct protocol handling
   - Catalog queries now work correctly with both simple and extended protocols

3. **Binary Encoding Support**: Fixed "invalid buffer size" errors
   - Catalog data is now properly formatted for binary result encoding
   - Added special handling for numeric columns (attnum, attlen, etc.)
   - PRIMARY KEY columns are correctly identified as NOT NULL

4. **Column Projection**: Implemented for pg_attribute handler
   - SELECT specific columns now returns only those columns
   - Handles wildcard (*) and column aliases correctly
   - Fixed test failures related to column index mismatches

5. **Test Infrastructure**: Improved diagnostic test handling
   - Trace tests that intentionally panic are now marked with #[ignore]
   - Can still be run manually for debugging with --ignored flag
